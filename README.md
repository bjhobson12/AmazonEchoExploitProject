# Getting Started with Create React App

This project demonstrates how an XSS vulnerability is created.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to install libraries.
Then start the project by running `npm start`
Finally run `node server.js` to start the server to listen to cookies

After these steps, opening the app in a web browser will demonstrate the comments. The malicious comment will be loaded into the app after one second, and the cookie will be sent to the exploit server and settle into `./stolen_cookies_log.txt`
